  "title": "min-ratio-cycle: Fast minimum cost-to-time ratio cycle detection in directed graphs",
  "description": "A high-performance Python library for finding minimum cost-to-time ratio cycles in directed graphs. Features NumPy-accelerated algorithms with exact Stern-Brocot search for integer inputs, comprehensive validation, performance analytics, and visualization tools. Implements Lawler's parametric search with vectorized Bellman-Ford negative cycle detection for applications in finance, operations research, network engineering, and supply chain optimization.",
