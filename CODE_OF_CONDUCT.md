## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at **[dfr@esmad.ipp.pt](mailto:dfr@esmad.ipp.pt)**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
